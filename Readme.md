APKExpansionFiles

This is just like HelloWorld app for "APK Expansion files" concept. To do this application you need the following things.

Active google play Account.
Selected images, audios etc..(I tested with Zip file)
If you follow the https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html. It suggest to import the following projects

APK Expansion Zip Library (SDK/extras/google/play_apk_expansion/zip_file)
Application Licensing (SDK/extras/google/market_licensing)
Downloader Library (SDK/extras/google/play_apk_expansion/downloader_library)
Note: If anyone clone or download this project you don't need to add or import these project. I have added everything required.

Important: You need to create new project on google play console and get your Base64 publick key. This you need to update in your "DownloaderService.java" file.
